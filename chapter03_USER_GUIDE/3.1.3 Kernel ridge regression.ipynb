    "## 3.1.3 Kernel ridge regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Kernelridgeregression(KRR) combines Ridge Regression(linear least squares with l2-norm regularization) with the kernel trick. It thus learns a linear function in the space induced by the respective kernel and the data. For non-linear kernels, this corresponds to a non-linear function in the original space. \n",
    "\n",
    "The form of the model learned by KernelRidge is identical to support vector regression (SVR). However, different loss functions are used: KRR uses squared error loss while support vector regression uses $\\epsilon$-insensitive loss, both combined with l2 regularization. Incontrast to SVR, ﬁtting Kernel Ridge can be done in closed-form and is typically faster for medium-sized datasets. On the other hand, the learned model is non-sparse and thus slower than SVR, which learns a sparse model for $\\epsilon$ > 0, at prediction-time. "
